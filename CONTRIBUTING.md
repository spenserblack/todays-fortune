## Adding words

This is the easiest way to contribute, and it's welcome! There are lists of adjectives,
nouns, and verbs in the [words directory][words].

There are a few rules to follow:

- One word per line.
- Don't add duplicate words, nor alternative spellings[^1].
- Lowercase, as if the word was in the middle of a sentence (because it will be).
- Words should be in alphabetical order.
- Words should be grammatically correct.

[^1]: If you would like to see the UK flavour of English rather than the USA flavor,
open an issue to discuss this feature :smile:
